1. Controllers
The controllers directory contains the logic for handling requests and returning responses. Controllers interact with services to perform the required operations.

2. Services
The services directory contains the business logic of the application. Services interact with external APIs, databases, or other services to perform operations.

3. Routes
The routes directory defines the API endpoints and maps them to controller functions.
